# Voice-Separaion-and-Enhancement
## Discription  
This program consists of several popular methods and its variants for speech separation and enhancement. The purposes of this program are to realize, test and compare methods quickly. The default model of microphone array is 6+1 circular array. Test data are generated by ISM method based on TIMIT database. Voicebox toolbox is required.  
All codes are written and updated in Matlab by Ke Zhang. If you find any bugs, please contact me.(zhangke9311@163.com)  
The list of metods:  
Beamforming:  
* DSB  
* MVDR  
* LCMV  
* maxSNR/GEVD  

Blind source separation(BSS):  
* ICA  
* IVA  
* AuxIVA  
* OverIVA  
* ILRMA  
* FastMNMF  

In general, methods in beamforming use the steering vector or other spatial information of sources to enhance the target speech, and BSS methods use the number of sources except some cases for solving the permutation ambiguity.  
## Guide for users  
1. The main function is command.m in which you can set the number and angle of sound sources, and select the algorithms in the list you want to test(set the value behind the corresponding method to 1 for running, 0 for not). Simulation environment can be set in ISM_setup.m, such as T60 for reveberation, configures of microphone array and NoiseFlag for noise adding,etc.  
2. In Process.m, the steering vector of sound sources are calculated by the function 'Cal_transfer' and the length of window for fft is set. The plotting and generation of separated signals are controlled by 'sign_plot' and 'sign_write' in Process.m. The performance of methods are shown in the top right corner of the plotting figure where the column with 2 numbers consists of SIR improved and SIR output and the column with 3 numbers consists of SDR, SIR and SAR.   
3. CommandOnline.m and OnProcess.m designed for online methods which process input signals by blocks, not whole ,but seldom use and not updated frequently.
